These files are OPTIONAL files if you would like to create more colors for the stethoscope. Simply change layer 3 (the pink boxes) to whatever color to change the 'rubber' parts of the stethoscope. 

Saved as both .pdn (for paint.NET) & .psd (for photoshop).
I use paint.NET so apologies if the .psd file does not have the layer information stored. I just used a plugin to export as .psd
